# ptx-spsp
A matlab toolkit for designing pTx spatial spectral (spsp) RF pulses. 
You may run the demo script, `pTxSpSp.m`, to grab an idea of how this toolbox can be used to design pTx spsp (2D spatial + 1D spectral) pulses to create a target arbitrarily shaped excitation pattern while achieving a prescribed frequency response. 

If you find the toolbox helpful, please consider citing the following ISMRM abstract:
